💻 Embracing the Challenges of Programming

Hi there! My name is Awab Abdelgadir and I'm an aspiring engineer.

I absolutely love everything about programming - the logic, the problem-solving, the challenges. I find it incredibly rewarding to take a complex problem and break it down into smaller pieces, then use code to solve each piece and bring the solution to life.As I've delved deeper into the world of computer science, I've realized that I'm now just as drawn to working with physical devices and tangible inputs and outputs as much as I am with programming software. I enjoy the feeling of building and creating something tangible, and the satisfaction that comes with it. That's why I'm now trying to transition into programming hardware and developing mobile apps. I'm excited to apply my programming skills to these areas and have a more tangible understanding of computer science.

If you're also interested in hardware programming or mobile app development, feel free to reach out and connect with me. I'm always open to discussing new ideas and learning from others.

Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding! 🐻
